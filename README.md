# Project Goals

## General Air Quality Information for the Public

By providing trailheads/trails in Colorado overlapped with today's and tomorrow's AQI map we are able to accurately display to people "better" times to hike in certain places.

## Hiking Trail Recommendation

Given a hiking trail, if the trail is not in a "good" air quality zone, it will recommend hiking a nearby trail that has better air quality.

## CPW Facility Mapping

Based on a set of CPW facilities that we have access to, the website will display them as either fishing or camping and allow users to see information about the AQI surrounding them.
